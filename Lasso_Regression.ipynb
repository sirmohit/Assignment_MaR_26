    "    Lasso Regression, or L1 regularization, is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term based on the absolute values of the coefficients to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function. This penalty term encourages sparsity in the coefficient vector by driving some of the coefficients exactly to zero. The term \"Lasso\" stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator.\n",

    "    Here are the key advantages of Lasso Regression in feature selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Automatic Variable Selection: Lasso Regression acts as an automatic feature selector by encouraging sparsity in the coefficient vector. The optimization process tends to set the coefficients of less important or redundant features to precisely zero, effectively excluding them from the model.\n",

    "    Simplicity of Model: The sparsity induced by Lasso leads to simpler and more interpretable models, as only a subset of predictors with non-zero coefficients contributes to the model. This is especially beneficial when dealing with large datasets with a large number of features.\n",

    "    Dealing with Multicollinearity: Lasso Regression is effective in handling multicollinearity, where predictors are highly correlated.

Here are some guidelines for interpreting coefficients in a Lasso Regression model:\n",
    "\n",

    "    Zero Coefficients:\n",

    "\n",
    "    The magnitude of non-zero coefficients can still be interpreted as the strength of the relationship between the predictor and the response, but this interpretation is in the context of the L1 regularization penalty, which encourages smaller magnitudes.\n",
    "    Impact of Regularization Parameter (α):The strength of the regularization in Lasso Regression is controlled by the hyperparameter α.

    "    x, you can include 2x or3x , and so on. Lasso Regression can then be applied to the expanded set of features.\n",
