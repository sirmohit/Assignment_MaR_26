In situations where understanding the individual contribution of each feature is crucial, a less complex model might be preferred.\n",

    "    Selection of Regularization Parameter: The effectiveness of regularized linear models depends on the proper selection of the regularization parameter (alpha). Choosing an inappropriate value for alpha may result in over-regularization or under-regularization, impacting the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Not Suitable for Every Dataset: Regularized linear models may not be the best choice when the dataset is small or when there are very few informative features. In such cases, the penalty term may lead to overly aggressive shrinkage of coefficients, and the model might not capture the true underlying relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Difficulty Handling Collinearity: Regularized linear models can handle multicollinearity better than ordinary least squares regression, but they may still struggle in the presence of highly correlated features. In situations with strong multicollinearity, it can be challenging for these models to provide stable and reliable coefficient estimates.\n",
